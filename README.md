FixedAccordion
==============

An attempt to create the smoothest-possible accordion widgets using CSS3 transforms. For this reason, images of considerable size were chosen to stress-test the performance of expanding/collapsing sections.

Ordinarily, the accordions I use are powered solely by CSS with minimal JavaScript intervention. This doesn't fare well on mobile, however, which struggles to keep transitions smooth as an opening fold pushes following sections down the page. Unsatisfied with the jolty transitions on mobile, I decided to see if I could achieve a more smoother-looking effect.
